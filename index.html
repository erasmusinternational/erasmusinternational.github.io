      <h1>Election Manifesto</h1>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        Erasmus University is not just a study choice, it is a lifestyle
        commitment. Every single day, our campus becomes a vibrant point where
        hundreds of cultures, perspectives and ideas converge. Our friendships
        that span across the entire world, show the incredible power of this
        diverse community.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        Yet, budget cuts and the cost-of-living crisis are actively threatening
        this unique project. They put financial and mental stress on our student
        lives and demolish higher education.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        We understand that this is neither the time to sit back and proceed as
        normal, nor to turn people against each other: It is more urgent than
        ever to use our combined power to fight back.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        The university council is an important tool in this regard: It has to
        approve budget resolutions, can use its ties to the executive board and
        directly votes on shaping the organisation of our university. We will
        use these means to continuously advocate for the interests of our
        international student community.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        At the same time, we acknowledge that there is only so and so much we
        can influence with our seats. The council cannot reverse budget cuts of
        the national government and new ideas unfortunately, more often than
        not, are stalled by an overly bureaucratic system.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        Erasmus International understands that our work does not end in the
        university council: We want to report back what has been discussed to
        all students and become part of a bigger movement. A lot of problems
        cannot solely be solved by some council or university staff members, by
        some students, some activists or protesters alone. Erasmus University
        needs a party that understands that and brings people together.
      </p>

      <h2 style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        <a name="_8mfvu5aipm0"></a>1. Fight back against budget cuts and costs
        of living
      </h2>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        The Dutch government’s decision to cut over a billion euros in higher
        education will largely affect our every-day university life: larger
        classes and tutorials, demolition of buildings, less student housing and
        rising tuition fees. Everybody is already feeling the effects, and this
        is only the beginning.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10pt">
        Even though it often does not seem like that, no political decisions are
        irreversible or final. On the one hand, there is no guarantee that these
        budget cuts will be the last ones to come, on the other hand, there is
        hope that the budget cuts will be revoked if enough people stand up to
        this disastrous decision. We will
        <b
          >on every step of the way support the demonstrations and strikes
          against the budget cuts</b
        >, use our ties at the university council and existing party structures
        to mobilise as many people as possible. Budget cuts will increase the
        workload and stress of the university staff and thereby lower the
        quality of our education: We have their back by endorsing the upcoming
        strikes. Effectively standing up for our student interests definitely
        requires more than a majority on the council: We will
        <b>seek to form a close collaboration with the student union Stuur</b>
        and form ties with other student and activist groups.
      </p>

      </h2>

      <p style="text-align: justify">
        Students in all faculties are disillusioned with the council politics.
        Why? Because all parties only appear a couple of weeks before elections
        to beg for your vote, get a nice CV boost when they get elected and then
        go quiet for the next 12 months. Can you name a single thing that the
        council has done for you in the last 6 months? Nobody knows what is
        happening in the council and most of the current parties want to keep
        you disinterested in order to make their work of “representing you”
        easier.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify">
        We promise to be better and through that force all other parties to step
        up their game as well. Here is everything we will do to turn the council

        Our university is extremely diverse, and we want everyone to feel

        on our campus, as they face adaptation difficulties, mental health

        academic progress and building a stable social life.

        We stand for an open community and aim to make international students'

        us with their complaints and ideas, and we will promote them further.

        in getting internships will attract attention, making these problems
        harder to ignore.
